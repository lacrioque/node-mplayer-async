node-mplayer-async
==================

A node.js wrapper for MPlayer on Linux. It's currently focused on sound playing, more options and video playing will come later.
Promises rely on the great q library

##Usage

First, install the module with (assuming you already installed MPlayer)

	npm install node-mplayer-async

Then, you need to make a new instance of the module. The constructor of the module can take the path of the file to play. 

	var Mplayer = require('node-mplayer-async'); 
    
	var player1 = new Mplayer('/home/node/Music/Kalimba.mp3');
    var player2 = new Mplayer();
    
##Available methods

###play

This method will play the file defined when the player object was instanciated or setted with `setFile()`. This method MUST be called before any other. 
It can take in parameter an object that contains the volume and the number of times to play the file (see `setVolume` and `setLoop`).

	player.play();
    player.play({volume: 50});
    player.play({volume: 50,
    			loop: 10});

###stop

This method will stop the played file. 

	player.stop();
    
###pause

This one will toggle pause.

	player.pause();
    
###mute

The method to toggle mute

	player.mute();
    
###setVolume

This method is used to set the volume. It takes one parameter, the volume value that can go from 1 to 100.

	player.setVolume(52);    //will set the volume to 52%

###seek

This method is used to navigate in the playing file. It take one parameter, the seek value in seconds that goes from 0 to the end of the file. This value is absolute.

	player.seek(50);    //will go to 50 seconds

###setLoop

This will set the number of times to replay the file. The parameter is the number of times, -1 is forever.

	player.setLoop(20);    //will play the file 20 times
    
###setSpeed

This will set the playing speed. It takes one parameter, the speed. 1 is the default speed.

	player.setSpeed(0.5);    //will play the file 0.5x slower
    player.setSpeed(20);    //will play the file 20x faster
    
###setFile

This one is used to set the file to play. The changes will take effect after calling the `play()` method. It takes the path of the file in parameter.

	player.setFile('/home/node/Music/asdf.mp3');

###getTimeLength

Returns the length of the file in seconds. Returns a promise

	player.getTimeLength()
    .then(function(length){
        console.log(length);
    }

###getTimePosition

Returns the elapsed play time in seconds. It needs a callback.

	player.getTimePosition()
    .then(function(length){
        console.log(length);
    }

###getMetaData

Return metadata of the file that is played in the for of an object.
{artist: "Some Artist", title: "Some Title", album: "Some Album"}

    getMetaData()
    .then(function(metaData){
        console.log(metaData);
    });

##Events

###end

The end event is emitted when the file has ended.

###error

The error event is emitted when an error has ocurred.

##Stability

This module uses the [`readline`](http://www.nodejs.org/api/readline.html) module, which is currently marked unstable. 

This module has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with MPlayer 1.1-4.8.
